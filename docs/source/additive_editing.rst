Curve Chains
============

**Curve to Armature** - Creates Armature from Curve, while keeping original Curve Object, and a new Mesh (i.e., original curve converted to mesh)

**Curve 2 Arm Skin Rig** - Creates Armature from Curve, while keeping original Curve Object, and a new Mesh (i.e., original curve converted to mesh) with
Skin Modifier applied to mesh

**Curve to Simple Armature** - Creates a low resolution Armature from Curve based on number of control points on Curve (i.e., number of curve vertices),
while keeping original Curve Object, and a new low resolution Mesh (i.e., low resolution copy of original curve converted to mesh)


**Curve 2 Simp Arm Skin Rig** - Creates a low resolution Armature from Curve based on number of control points on Curve (i.e., number of curve vertices),
while keeping original Curve Object, and a new low resolution Mesh (i.e., low resolution copy of original curve converted to mesh) with Skin Modifier
applied to mesh



**Curve 2 Simp Cloth Arm** - Creates a low resolution Armature from Curve based on number of control points on Curve (i.e., number of curve vertices),
while keeping original Curve Object, and a new low resolution Mesh (i.e., low resolution copy of original curve converted to mesh) with Cloth simulations
modifier applied to mesh
